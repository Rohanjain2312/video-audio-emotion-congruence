# Sample Videos

Sample videos are not included in the repository due to size constraints.

## To get sample videos:

After downloading datasets, run:
```bash
python organize_samples.py --samples_dir data/samples
```

This will select 10 diverse videos from the downloaded RAVDESS dataset and rename them with readable names.
