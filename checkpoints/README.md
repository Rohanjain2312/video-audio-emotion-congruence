# Model Checkpoints

Model checkpoints are not included in the repository due to size constraints.

## To get trained models:

### Option 1: Train yourself
```bash
# Train multimodal model
python src/training/train_multimodal.py

# Train baselines
python src/training/train_video_only.py
python src/training/train_audio_only.py
```

### Option 2: Download from Hugging Face (coming soon)
Pre-trained models will be available on Hugging Face Hub.
